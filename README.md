## What is SGT-Analyser?
The SGT-Analyser is an tool for the automated analysis of growth-curves of, in an checkerboard-style treated bacteria.
The goal is to determine synergistic, additional or antagonistic effects between the two applied antibiotics.
For this the so called *"Start Growth Time"*-method is used.

## Getting started
You can use this program either in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataSpott/sgt_analysis/blob/master/sgt_analyser.ipynb) or in your terminal.
The use via Google Colab is suited for non-informaticians and
provides a graphical interface to interact with.
To use the terminal-variant some informatical knowledge is required 
to setup the modules and use the flags.
Further you will need an Excel-file with the data of your growth curves

In the following is described how to use either of this options.

### Using *SGT_Analyser* in Google Colab
* use the link *["Open in Colab"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataSpott/sgt_analysis/blob/master/sgt_analyser.ipynb)*
* You will be directed to a Google Colab-site, where the program is setup
* start each block after the preceding, following the instrcutions given at the site

### Using *SGT-Analyser* in the terminal
For the use of *SGT-Analyser* in your terminal there are two options.

**1. Setup on your own system:**
* clone this git-repository to your computer using the command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataSpott/SGT-Analysis.git
```

* if not already installed use the following command to install pip for python3 in your terminal
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

* use the following command to set up the necessary python-modules
```bash
pip3 install pandas altair xlrd altair_saver selenium scipy tabulate IPython
```

* to start the *SGT-Analyser* use the following command in the repository directory
```bash
./sgt_analyser.py --help
```

**2. Use the docker-container:**
* make sure docker is installed at your system as described under https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* use following command to pull the docker-image to your system, mount all data in the current directory to *"/input"* in the container and execute it
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/input dataspott/sgt_analyser:v0.9.1 sgt_analyser.py -i /input/tecan_infinite_test_data.xlsx
```
* to get help and see how to use the program use the following command
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/input dataspott/sgt_analyser:v0.9.1 sgt_analyser.py --help
```

## Further information
Detailed instructions about the setup and use of *"SGT-Analyser"* can be found in the manual provided in this repository.
